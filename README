Fix for SCP-914, made by Xy for GFL Breach. Released to the public under the terms of the MIT License.
This is only intended to work on gm_site19, published by the user kammorne on the GMOD workshop.

This script is not maintained what so ever, if it suddenly breaks, I may update it, but I probably won't.

If something doesn't work, make an issue, but before doing so:

 - Check to make sure the map you're using the June, 24th 2017 version
 - If it is not, make sure you have replaced *216 and *221 with the proper values
 - Check to make sure the gamemode/any addon you are using doesn't return improperly in the PlayerUse hook. You can test this by adding print('Hello!') to the player use hook in the 914fix.lua file

To install this: Just clone the repository into your server's addon folder.
